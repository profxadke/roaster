# roaster

Simple repository, that makes use of REST API endpoint https://github-roast.pages.dev/llama (taken from: https://github.com/codenoid/github-roast/) for generating roasts/insults, based on your GitHub username.

#### Quickly check the code block below to have some idea:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/profxadke/roaster/ && cd roaster
$ pip install -Ur requirements.txt  # or, you might want to use uv/virtualenv/venv here
$ python3 ./main.py profxadke  # I know its pretty brutal ðŸ’€ðŸ¥²
$ python3 ./main.py  # this would also work, username prompt is via `input` function.
```
